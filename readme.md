this repo will be worked out to be like the win-setup repo after i have found myself the right repo and properly established myself with gpu + monitor support

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
so far what ive found for myself:

most "end game/customizable" distro that isn't containers (distrobox) or virtualization (VanillaOS? must recheck): [Bedrock Linux](https://bedrocklinux.org/)https://bedrocklinux.org/
"fastest" arch-based/fork distro (systemd only): [CachyOS](https://cachyos.org/)https://cachyos.org/

"fastest" arch-based/fork distro in BOOT TIME: [Artix Linux (community built iso if base iso install is too complicated)](https://artixlinux.org/download.php#official) with **dinit** and **LXDE**

someone's effort to use cachyos repos on artix: https://www.reddit.com/r/artixlinux/comments/15cl4rp/comment/jty08qq


best IMMUTABLE pre-configured gaming distro: [Bazzite desktop variant (HTPC variant only supports AMD gpus at the time of writing this)](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/#desktop)
